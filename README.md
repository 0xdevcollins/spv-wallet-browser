## Getting Started (Alpha)

The alpha version of the wallet is open and available to all users. While it has been tested, it is still new software so use at your own risk. The plan once out of alpha/beta is to launch on the Google Chrome Store.

   . \*\*Always double check that you are at the official Panda Wallet github repo before downloading anything. https://github.com/Panda-Wallet/panda-wallet.

   **v0.0.1 SHA256 Checksum:** For extra security you can check the checksum:

   `29eaa08e0ea88175ee88fe60dd302dbdfacd294a0462edfda98e32421f970a08`

   Files can also be found in `public/builds`

3. **Load The Build File:** In the top right of Chrome Extensions, enable dev mode, then on the left select "Load unpacked".
