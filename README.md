## Getting Started (Alpha)

The alpha version of the wallet is open and available to all users. While it has been tested, it is still new software so use at your own risk. The plan once out of alpha/beta is to launch on the Google Chrome Store.

1. **Download:** First you will need to [Download The Current Build](https://github.com/Panda-Wallet/panda-wallet/blob/main/public/builds/panda-wallet-0.0.1.zip)
   . \*\*Always double check that you are at the official Panda Wallet github repo before downloading anything. https://github.com/Panda-Wallet/panda-wallet.

   **v0.0.1 SHA256 Checksum:** For extra security you can check the checksum. Files can also be found in `public/builds`:
   `29eaa08e0ea88175ee88fe60dd302dbdfacd294a0462edfda98e32421f970a08`

2. **Unzip:** Unzip the build zip file then head to [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. **Load The Build File:** In the top right of Chrome Extensions, enable dev mode, then on the left select "Load unpacked".
4. **Finish:** If you did this properly, you should now see Panda Wallet available in the list of extensions. You can now manage and pin the extension just like you would any other Chrome extension you have.

## Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

1. **Small and Focused Changes:**

   - PRs should focus on addressing a specific issue, implementing a single feature, or fixing a bug. Keep changes small and avoid bundling unrelated changes in the same PR.

2. **Branch Naming Convention:**

   - Use descriptive branch names that reflect the purpose of the PR. For example, use `feature/add-authentication` or `bugfix/fix-login-issue`.

3. **Code Quality:**

   - Ensure your code follows the project's coding style and conventions.
   - Run linters and code formatters before submitting a PR to maintain code quality.

4. **Test Coverage:**

   - Write tests for new features or changes to ensure they work as expected.
   - Ensure existing tests continue to pass with your changes.

5. **Documentation:**

   - Update documentation to reflect any changes made in the PR.
   - Include code comments where necessary to explain complex logic.

6. **Commit Messages:**

   - Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of each commit.
   - Use a conventional format like "feat(ordinal): implement transfers" or "fix(service-worker): resolve issue with listener."

7. **Rebase and Resolve Conflicts:**

   - Before merging, ensure your PR is up-to-date with the latest changes from the main branch. Resolve any conflicts that arise during the rebase.

8. **Peer Review:**

   - Request a code review from one or more maintainers.
   - Reviewers should provide constructive feedback and check for code quality, functionality, and adherence to project standards.

9. **CI/CD Checks:**

   - Ensure any continuous integration (CI) tests pass successfully.
   - Make sure the code builds and deploys correctly in the target environment.

10. **Use Labels and Milestones:**

    - Apply labels to categorize PRs (e.g., bug, feature, documentation).
    - Associate PRs with project milestones when applicable.

11. **Avoid Force Pushing:**

    - Once a PR is open, avoid force-pushing changes to the branch. If you need to update the PR, make new commits.

12. **Ownership and Responsibility:**

    - Assign the PR to the person responsible for reviewing and merging it.
    - Authors should address feedback promptly and engage in the review process.

13. **Merging:**

    - PRs should be merged after receiving approval from reviewers and passing all checks.

14. **Delete Branches:**

    - After a successful merge, delete the feature or bugfix branch unless it's a long-lived branch or follows a specific naming convention (e.g., `release/1.0`).

15. **Changelog Updates:**

    - If your project maintains a changelog, update it with changes introduced in the PR.

16. **Security and Compliance:**

    - Consider security implications in your code changes.

17. **Communication:**

    - Provide context and any relevant information in the PR description.
